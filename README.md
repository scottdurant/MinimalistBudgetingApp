# Minimalist Budgeting App

This project is an Android app built with React Native that will help users budget their money. The main goal was to create something simple and
easy to use, which will encourage users to enter their purchases regularly and stay within their budgets.

## Structure
The main directories to look at are the `components` and `screens` directories. `components` includes things such as the `AddPurchase` component, which displays a text input and a button for users to enter a purchase. `screens` contains all of the screens for the app, such as the `HomeScreen`, and `AddPurchaseScreen`. 

## Getting Started
The easiest way to run this app is to download the [Expo Client App](https://expo.io/tools) on your Android device from the Google Play Store. Then use the Expo Client App to scan the QR code found on the [Minimalist Budgeting App Expo Page](https://expo.io/@scottd/MinimalistBudgetingApp).


Otherwise, follow these steps (adapted from the [React Native Getting Started Page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)) if you want to run this app on your local machine for development/testing purposes. Check the React Native instructions if you run into problems.


### Prerequisites

Install [Node 10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```



### Installing and running

Next, clone the repository, change directories, and run. 

```
git clone https://github.com/scottdurant/MinimalistBudgetingApp.git
```

```
cd MinimalistBudgetingApp
```

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

You may need to run `npm install` in the project directory if `npm start` causes errors. 

From this point, you can install the [Expo Client for Android](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your Android device and scan the QR code to run the app.

You can also follow the more detailed [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) instructions to get the app running on an emulator.
