# Minimalist Budgeting App

This project is a React Native app that will help users budget their money. The main goal with this project is to create something that is simple and
easy to use, which will encourage users to enter their purchases regularly and stay within their budgets.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run this app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Install [Node 10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```



### Installing

Next, clone the repository, change directories, and run. 

```
git clone https://github.com/scottdurant/MinimalistBudgetingApp.git
```

```
cd MinimalistBudgetingApp
```

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

From this point, you can install the [Expo Client for Android](https://expo.io/tools#client) on a phone and scan the QR code to run the app on an actual Android device.
Or, you can also follow the more detailed [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) instructions to get an emulator installed and running.
