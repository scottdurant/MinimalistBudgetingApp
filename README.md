# Minimalist Budgeting App

This project is an Android app build with React Native that will help users budget their money. The main goal with this project is to create something that is simple and
easy to use, which will encourage users to enter their purchases regularly and stay within their budgets.

## Structure
The main directories to look at are the `components` and `screens` directories. `components` includes things such as the `AddPurchase` component, which displays a text input and a button for users to enter a purchase. `screens` contains all of the screens for the app, such as the `HomeScreen`, and `AddPurchaseScreen`. 

## Getting Started
If you just want to run the app on your Android device, visit the [Expo Page](https://expo.io/@scottd/MinimalistBudgetingApp) and scan the QR code with the [Expo Client App](https://expo.io/tools) on your Android device.

If you want to play with the code, follow these steps (adapted from the [React Native Getting Started Page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)) to run this app on your local machine for development/testing purposes. Check the React Native instructions if you run into problems. 


### Prerequisites

Install [Node 10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```



### Installing and running

Next, clone the repository, change directories, and run. 

```
git clone https://github.com/scottdurant/MinimalistBudgetingApp.git
```

```
cd MinimalistBudgetingApp
```

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

You may need to run `npm install` in the project directory if `npm start` causes errors. 

From this point, you can install the [Expo Client for Android](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your Android device and scan the QR code to run the app.

You can also follow the more detailed [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) instructions to get the app running on an emulator.
